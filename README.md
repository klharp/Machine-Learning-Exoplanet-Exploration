# Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration

![exoplanets.jpg](Images/exoplanets.jpg)


## Background

Created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset provided from the NASA Kepler space telescope that has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

Ths assignment demonstrates:

1. Preprocessing the raw data
2. Tuning the models
3. Comparing multiple models

## Report

* Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).
